      <h3>PRICING</h3>
      <p>
        All items displayed on the Hebe website for sale state their full retail
        price. This price is often indicated by the supplier and sometimes
        reflects our calculated price based on industry standard. Our sale items
        will be displayed reflecting the discounted price in the case a discount
        code hasn't been offered to customers. Every so often human error occurs
        and something may not be right. In this case, we endeavour to contact
        you straight away and adjust or correct the issue. If you notice
        something that looks incorrect, don't hesitate to contact us directly
        and we can rectify the problem. In the instance of an under-priced item
        advertised on the site, we will contact you and you are entitled to
        cancel or continue with your adjusted order.
      </p>
      <h3>COSTUMER ACCOUNTS</h3>
      <p>
        The customer is solely responsible for the use of their account and all
        passwords and information attached to the account. The customer agrees
        that all information supplied on the account that represents your
        relationship with Hebe is true and correct. If Hebe Designer Boutique
        feels that inaccurate or false information has been supplied or your
        account has been violated, your account may be terminated by Hebe.
      </p>
      <h3>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS</h3>
      <p>
        Hebe strives to maintain a clear level of communication on the site and
        utilises imagery from brands to display our available product. We at
        Hebe write our own descriptions on the products unless the brand prefers
        otherwise. Occasionally there may be a discrepancy with an item or the
        colour of the image etc. If you are having difficulty with a certain
        product not being as described, please contact us and return it in new
        condition so we can process a refund, credit or exchange for you.

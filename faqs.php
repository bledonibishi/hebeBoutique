          Yes! Hebe is delighted to offer Laybuy online, you'll see the little
          heart logo appear next to all items. This amazing service is run by a
          third party and enables you to receive your parcel straight away,
          spreading the cost over 6 payments made to Laybuy from the date of
          your purchase- wear now and pay later! We can also process Laybuy
          instore so you can utilize this service at any time. In addition to
          Laybuy, we offer ZipPay too as some of you have a preference, and some
          of you have an account with both. With the same 'wear now, pay later'
          structure as Laybuy, payments with ZipPay are spread over fortnightly
          instalments instead. You will also see the ZipPay logo next to each
          item online. Zip Pay is also available to use instore on our POS. All
          part-payment gateways are available to use on SALE ITEMS- yay! There
          are no refund restrictions on Laybuy or ZipPay (we follow our usual
          guidelines). Traditional layby is also available in-store (leave your
          purchase with us and pay as you like over 6 weeks), just ask us if
          you'd like to utilise this service.

          Yes! On our left hand drop-down menu you will see Gift Cards. Select
          or add to the value you would like, then checkout as normal. If you
          would like a specific value (e.g you and your siblings are all going
          in and you want it to the dollar!) then simply get in touch and we can
          add a custom value to the website for you. Please note, all Gift Cards
          will be emailed to the purchasers email address. There currently is no
          feature that allows you to nominate a recipient. You can either print
          off the gift card and insert in to a card, or forward the email to the
          lucky person.

          If you have purchased in-store with the opportunity to try it on, you
          are eligible for a return, but not a refund. We will assist you by
          offering an exchange or credit note, no questions asked. We understand
          that online shopping can require a little guess work, so we like to
          replicate a simple return for our online gals too. If you find that
          your online order isn't right for you, just get in touch. To assist we
          can- source a replacement size/style, give a credit note or a refund.
          Check out our checklist steps under ‘Return Policy’ to ensure a
          successful return (new condition, tags attached and all that!). Please
          note that return shipping is at the expense of the customer. For more
          info on this please refer to our Shipping page. Sale items are
          unfortunately not eligible for return. All sale transactions are
          final, so please consider carefully. Ask us if you need any help at
          all.

          We can keep an item aside for one day. Although the item will
          physically be off the rack in-store, it will still be available online
          during that time unless discussed otherwise. Call or message us to
          hold something.

          If an item is out of stock, you will see 'sold out' stated under the
          product. Some styles may take a day or so to be uploaded online, we
          are a busy physical store and sometimes our loved styles are snapped
          up before they make it to the website. If you have a question about a
          particular item you think we may stock, please call us and we can help
          you locate it! We also have a pink button under each item that says
          'email me when available'. This allows you to be notified once we
          restock. Hebe has a high stock rotation and some items that go out of
          stock will not come back. This is because we like to provide limited
          pieces that are not saturated on the market.

          Hebe ships in collaboration with GoSweetSpot. We charge a flat rate of
          $6 for any clothing purchase to be couriered overnight (or 1-2days
          depending) nationwide. For accessories a $4 flat rate applies. All
          orders over $250 acquire FREE SHIPPING. GoSweetSpot do allow us to
          deliver to PO Boxes, however, we prefer to deliver to a physical
          address for several reasons. If you are local, feel free to select the
          'Pick up in-store' option and we will have your parcel ready and
          wrapped for you to collect. If you're after a local delivery, just a
          $3 fee applies and your parcel can be delivered after shop hours for
          Masterton and Carterton areas. You can find more deets on our Shipping
          page. There is a $10 charge for parcels to Australia and a $20 charge
          internationally.

          Yes and it's a goodie! At Hebe we consider every one of our customers
          a VIP so our loyalty system is available to everyone who shops with
          us- locally and online. Our rewards system gives you 10% back on your
          spending, so every $700 spent earns you a $70 voucher! Whoop. You are
          able to see your points accumulate on your account. To join up if
          you're not already a VIP, simply create an account on our website and
          log in. When you reach a reward, a coupon will be emailed to you with
          a running points balance. If you shop in-store with us, the same
          applies and we can redeem your voucher in-store as well- it's all
          synced. To check your rewards online, tap on the black box in the left
          hand corner that says 'check rewards'. Treat yourself and we will
          treat you! x

        <label for="">
        <p class="faqs--content faqs--content--10">
          Ethical fashion is when a garment has been consciously made to
          encompass quality, fair trade and sustainable practices. For some
          brands this means keeping all of their processes in NZ, for others it
          means supporting small communities off-shore who produce garments and
          paying them a fair wage and supplying great working conditions, it can
          also mean designing and creating their own fabrics or for others it
          may be using up surplus fabric stocks that were otherwise going to
          waste. Our whole ethos at Hebe is focused on ethical fashion and
          supporting NZ designers and makers as much as possible. We pride
          ourselves on curating an amazing edit for you that offers a little
          something for everyone. The majority of our labels are NZ designed,
          with a couple being designed in Australia. A chunk of them are NZ made
          and some are ethically made off-shore. We have built incredible
          relationships with our brands and know that everything is created with
          love, putting good values and quality at the forefront.

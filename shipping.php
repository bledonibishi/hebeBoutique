      For all online orders we offer the option to ‘pick up instore’ which means
      you can whip in and pick up your parcel. Your purchase will be packaged
      up, ready to go! If you’re not able to get out of the house but are local,
      we are happy to deliver your item to your door. There is a charge of just
      $3 and delivery takes place after shop hours (5pm-7pm). Delivery applies
      to Masterton and Carterton.

    <h2>SHIPPING COSTS</h2>
    <p>
      Hebe Boutique is aligned with GoSweetSpot who ensure you get the safest,
      most efficient shipping possible including Saturday and overnight
      delivery. The majority of couriers we use deliver overnight nationwide,
      yay! All customers with an online transaction total over $200 get FREE
      shipping! We charge a flat rate of $6 per package (based on mean
      calculations) for any purchase of clothing- this is regardless of whether
      it is overnight, Saturday or rural. FYI rural parcels can be around $15 to
      send to the South Island, so our aim is to make it reasonable for all. Our
      standard is that you receive prompt, express delivery with live tracking.
      If this is ever not the case, please get in touch with us. The couriers
      work their bums off and are great guys- so lets see what we can sort for
      you. A charge of $4.00 applies for any purchase of jewellery or an
      accessory (sunglasses, watches etc.) Please guys, select the correct
      shipping at checkout. If you select 'pick up instore' and you really want
      it couriered instead, we will give you a tinkle to say that the charge is
      $6. As we support ethical, NZ designed brands and use local couriers, this
      is simply the cost of shipping. Thanks for your understanding on this.
      Please provide a satisfactory physical address as it is preferable to a PO
      Box, although we can send to a PO Box if need be. The only time you may
      experience a delay is during Public Holidays or if there is an unexpected
      interruption due to weather or a break down. Communication with each
      courier service via GoSweetSpot is thorough and easy, you will have a live
      track of your parcel at all times. Otherwise, contact us and we can follow
      up. If you are returning an item to us for a refund, your shipping fees
      are non-refundable. The cost to return the item to the store is also at
      the customers expense. If you are returning an item to us for an exchange,
      we will send your replacement free of charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shipping to Australia-$10 shipping fee applies.You can expect your parcel
      in 5-15 working days (excluding Public Holidays) providing that it doesn’t
      get stopped in customs. We are unable to offer tracking international
      freight at this time unless arranged alternatively to this service. If
      you'd like a tracked quote, email us.
    </p>
    <p>
      International - $20 shipping fee applies. Your goodies should arrive
      within 5-15 working days. We try our very best to deliver your goods in
      the fastest, safest way possible; this time frame is a guideline only.
      There is no tracking for items sent via International Economy. If you
      would like your item tracked, email us for a quote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hebe Boutique will not be held accountable for the misjudged arrival of
      items and the stated time frame provides an indication only. Please be
      aware that garments bought online over the weekend or on a Public Holiday
      may take an extra day or two for processing and delivery. We do not accept
      cancellations once your order is processed.
    </p>
    <h2>LOST PACKAGES</h2>
    <p>
      If any packages are completely lost in transit during the course of our
      delivery, we will replace or refund the item if shipped nationally. A
      claim would need to be lodged via the courier company and we would advise
      you of the result of the investigation. Once declared lost and
      undeliverable we can close the unfulfilled order with a refund to your
      preferred account. If you are returning an item to us, please know that we
      do not take any responsibility for items lost in the post. We recommend a
      track and trace method to ensure this doesn't happen; your garment cannot
      be processed for an exchange or a refund if we do not receive it.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks! x</p>
